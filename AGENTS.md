## Development Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Full build: TypeScript + Next.js web UI
npm run build:cli    # TypeScript only (faster)
npm test             # Run test suite (vitest)
npm run dev          # Watch mode for TypeScript
npm run mcp          # Start MCP server directly
npm run clean        # Remove dist/ and web/.next/
```

Build output goes to `dist/`. The MCP server entry point after build is `dist/mcp/server.js`.

## Plugin Architecture

### Plugin Manifests

Claude remains authoritative for host-specific behavior. The repo also ships an additive Codex surface.

Claude surface uses `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for metadata and Claude's
default-path discovery for runtime capabilities:
- Commands: `./commands/`
- Agents: `./agents/`
- Skills: `./skills/`
- Hooks: `./hooks/hooks.json` (empty by default; do not redeclare in the manifest)
- MCP servers: `./.mcp.json` (do not redeclare the default path in the manifest)

`scripts/install-plugin.sh` materializes a dependency-complete package, adds
that local directory as the `navgator` marketplace, installs and enables
`navgator@navgator` through the Claude CLI, and verifies the installed cache's
MCP process before reporting success. A filesystem symlink alone is not a
registered Claude plugin.

Codex surface (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) points to:
- Skills: `./skills/`
- MCP servers: `./.codex-plugin/mcp.json`
- Interface metadata for Codex UI

Codex does not discover Claude's `commands/` or `agents/` directories. Run
`scripts/install-codex-plugin.sh` to materialize the npm package at a non-empty
local marketplace path. The installer makes the MCP server entry absolute,
targets Codex's deterministic versioned cache, and removes the package-relative
`cwd`, so installed code is cache-owned while scan scope follows the active task
workspace. The script registers the path; the user
must still install/enable `navgator` in the Codex plugin browser and start a new
task.

### MCP Server

JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. Entry: `dist/mcp/server.js`.

12 tools exposed:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scan` | Detect components and connections; returns delta from last scan |
| `status` | Architecture summary with runtime topology and LLM use cases |
| `impact` | Blast-radius analysis for a named component |
| `connections` | All inbound/outbound connections for a component |
| `diagram` | Generate Mermaid diagram (full, component, layer, or summary) |
| `trace` | Data-flow trace forward and backward through the graph |
| `summary` | Executive summary for agent consumption |
| `review` | Architectural integrity review (drift, lessons, violations) |
| `explore` | Full detail on a specific component (type, layer, files, metadata) |
| `rules` | Rule checks: orphans, layer violations, cycles, hotspots |
| `portfolio` | Cross-repo dependency/service map; scans a local folder of repos, or reports over already-registered projects with no `dir` |
| `arch_diff` | Pre-merge architecture diff — current branch vs. canonical (or a named `base` ref) |

**`scan_remote` is deliberately not an MCP tool.** `navgator scan-remote <url>` runs `git clone` against a caller-supplied URL — exposing that as an agent-invokable tool would put a network fetch on a prompt-injection-reachable path (a malicious doc or tool output could smuggle a URL that gets cloned and scanned without a human in the loop). It ships CLI-only, human-initiated, and stays that way until a URL allowlist exists. `portfolio` and `arch_diff` were added instead because they operate over local paths only, with no equivalent network-fetch surface. Do not "fix" this omission by adding a `scan_remote` MCP tool without first landing an allowlist.

### Slash Commands (13)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/navgator:dead` | Find orphaned components — unused packages, models, queues, infra |
| `/navgator:gator` | Main router — dispatches to the right subcommand based on intent |
| `/navgator:impact` | Blast-radius analysis before modifying a component |
| `/navgator:lessons` | List, search, promote, and manage architecture lessons |
| `/navgator:llm-map` | Map all LLM use cases by purpose, provider, and connection |
| `/navgator:map` | Map full architecture — components, connections, topology, LLM use cases |
| `/navgator:plan` | Plan an architecture change or investigation (delegates to architecture-planner agent) |
| `/navgator:promote-lesson` | Scan per-project lessons and propose cross-project patterns for global promotion |
| `/navgator:review` | Architectural integrity review — connections, drift, lessons |
| `/navgator:scan` | Quick scan — refresh component and connection tracking |
| `/navgator:schema` | Show readers vs writers per database model |
| `/navgator:test` | End-to-end architecture test — verify components, connections, no orphans |
| `/navgator:trace` | Trace data flow forward and backward through the architecture |

### Skills (6)

`architecture-scan`, `architecture-export`, `navgator-setup`, `impact-analysis`, `code-review`, `infrastructure-scanning`

Skills have different auto-trigger patterns — check each `SKILL.md` before modifying trigger conditions.

### Hooks

`hooks/hooks.json` is intentionally empty. NavGator should be invoked explicitly through slash commands, MCP tools, or the CLI instead of adding automatic scan reminders to every session.

### Agents (4, Claude only)

**`architecture-advisor`** — Stack decisions, migration planning, dependency compatibility. Tools: Bash, Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch. Uses NavGator data to produce: Current State, Impact Analysis, Recommendation, Change Sequence, Verification.

**`architecture-investigator`** — SRE-style read-only investigation across 5 phases: Overview, Identify, Trace, Rules, Synthesize. Read-only during phases 1–4. Every finding cites specific tool output. Tools: Bash, Read, Glob, Grep.

**`architecture-planner`** — Graph freshness check + MCP-tool orchestration for architecture-aware questions. Reads `index.json` + `hashes.json`, runs `navgator scan --auto` if stale so configuration changes can trigger a required full refresh, then dispatches `impact`, `trace`, `connections`, `review`, `dead`, `rules` and returns a structured report. Triggers on phrasings like "review architecture for X", "blast radius of Y", "how does A connect to B".

**`external-resolver`** — Isolated external-boundary freshness resolver for packages and services. Updates NavGator's cache and returns structured drift evidence without mutating the architecture graph directly.

---

## Storage Model (Three-Tier Context + Home Stores)

Architecture data lives in `<project-root>/.navgator/architecture/`.

| Tier | Files | When to read |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Tier 1 — Hot | `NAVSUMMARY.md` (max ~150 lines) | Always first. Concise overview, AI routing table, delta |
| Tier 2 — Records and index | `components.full.jsonl`, `connections.full.jsonl`, `index.json`, `graph.json`, `file_map.json`, `prompts.json` | Complete records plus programmatic lookups and traversal |
| Tier 3 — Optional detail | `components/COMP_*.json`, `connections/CONN_*.json` | Opt-in stable per-record paths for external tooling |

Versioned JSON outputs use `schema_version: "1.1.0"`. Agent-mode output (`--agent` flag) wraps responses in a stable envelope with `command`, `data`, `schema_version`, and `timestamp`.

### Full Storage Structure

```
.navgator/architecture/
├── NAVSUMMARY.md          # Hot context — read first
├── NAVSUMMARY_FULL.md     # Full version if NAVSUMMARY was compressed
├── components.full.jsonl  # Canonical complete component records
├── connections.full.jsonl # Canonical complete connection records
├── index.json             # Derived component counts, types, layers, stats
├── graph.json             # Derived graph projection (lossy)
├── file_map.json          # Derived file path → component ID lookup
├── prompts.json           # LLM prompt content + provider associations
├── hashes.json            # File change detection
├── timeline.json          # Change history (diffs between scans)
├── connections.jsonl      # Compact connection projection (lossy)
├── reverse-deps.json      # Derived file → importers index
├── components/            # Optional COMP_*.json (--per-entity-files)
└── connections/           # Optional CONN_*.json (--per-entity-files)
```

The `*.full.jsonl` files are the canonical consolidated store. Per-entity directories are disabled by default and duplicate those records when enabled. Graph and compact formats are derived views and may omit fields.

Lessons accumulate in `.navgator/lessons/lessons.json`.

### Home-scoped stores (`~/.navgator/`)

Everything above is per-project and regenerable by rescanning. Four things live
in the user's home directory instead:

```
~/.navgator/
├── projects.json              # The registry — journaled + locked writes only
├── registry-journal.jsonl     # Forensic op log (digests, not identity; rotates)
├── lessons/global-lessons.json# Promoted cross-project patterns
└── memory/                    # gator-memory — durable narrative
    ├── index.json             #   materialized rollup (rebuildMemoryIndex only)
    ├── events.jsonl           #   append-only chronology, size-rotated
    └── projects/<slug>.json   #   DURABLE per-project record — source of truth
```

**gator-memory** answers *what happened over time* — which projects exist, when
they entered, what materially changed. Populated automatically on scan; no
setup, no dependency, no network. Only meaningful events are recorded
(`project.registered`, `project.scanned`, `architecture.changed`,
`project.removed`); a `patch`-significance rescan writes nothing.

**Rules for anything touching these:**

- Never write `projects.json` directly. Every mutation goes through
  `registerProject` / `updateProjectMeta` / `removeProject` / `pruneProjects`,
  which route via `mutateRegistry` (in-process mutex + cross-process file lock
  + compare-and-swap + journal record).
- Never put a shared-rollup write on the capture path. `index.json` is written
  only by `rebuildMemoryIndex()`, because `scanPortfolio` runs concurrent
  workers that all reach `registerProject`.
- Memory writes are fail-open and must stay outside both locks and outside
  `registerProject`'s registry try/catch.
- `~/.navgator/config.json` is the home-scoped config (`src/home-config.ts`);
  absent file means all defaults. Distinct from `src/config.ts`, which is
  project/storage-scoped and env-only.

`navgator doctor` reports hygiene across all of these. Design rationale:
`docs/plans/2026-08-03-gator-memory.md`.

## What NavGator Detects

The scanner (`src/scanner.ts` + `src/scanners/`) detects:

- **Packages:** npm, pip, SPM, and Cargo — dependency trees and version info
- **Prisma models:** schema parsing, relations, indexes, field-level usage
- **Environment variables:** `.env` files and `process.env` references in source
- **Queues:** BullMQ/Bull producers and consumers
- **Cron jobs:** `vercel.json`, `railway.json`, `node-cron` patterns
- **Deploy configs:** Vercel, Railway, Heroku service definitions
- **Swift/Xcode:** Package.swift, `.pbxproj`, Podfile, `.entitlements`, `Info.plist`
- **LLM prompts:** Prompt content extraction with provider associations
- **Markdown content:** Opt-in `--content` scanning for document components, Obsidian wikilinks, internal Markdown links, and typed frontmatter relationships; `.navgatorignore` controls corpus boundaries

---

## LLM Use Case Tracking

NavGator tracks **distinct use cases**, not raw import counts. Instead of "154 service calls," it reports "8 use cases across 3 providers."

Deduplication priority cascade (source: `src/llm-dedup.ts`):
1. Prompt-based grouping (strongest signal)
2. Function name grouping
3. callType + model grouping
4. File-based grouping (fallback)

Test and dev-only connections are filtered automatically.

---

## Runtime Topology

NavGator annotates components with runtime identity: service names, connection endpoints, and deploy targets extracted from code and config. Enables backward tracing from a runtime failure to the source code that produces it. `navgator status` shows a RUNTIME TOPOLOGY section.

---

## Change Guidance

| Area | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Component/connection detection | `src/scanners/` | Changes affect what gets detected during scan |
| Connection graph + impact | `src/impact.ts`, `src/trace.ts` | Graph traversal logic |
| LLM use-case dedup | `src/llm-dedup.ts` | Dedup cascade; test against real project outputs |
| NAVSUMMARY generation | `src/storage.ts` or scanner output | Keep output under 150 lines for hot context budget |
| MCP tools | `src/mcp/tools.ts` | Add new tools here; server.ts handles transport |
| Skills | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | 6 skills with different auto-trigger patterns |
| Commands | `commands/*.md` | Slash command prompt definitions |
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json` | Empty by default; changes affect all plugin consumers |
| Rule checks | `src/rules.ts` | Orphan, cycle, layer violation, hotspot detection |

---

## Key Constraints

- **NAVSUMMARY.md must stay under ~150 lines.** It is hot context — read at session start. Bloating it defeats the tier model.
- **MCP tools are the preferred interface for agents** — use `scan`, `explore`, `trace`, `impact`, `rules` rather than reading JSON files directly.
- **Storage path is `.navgator/`**, not `.claude/`. Migration logic exists for legacy paths.
- **`--agent` flag** wraps any command output in a stable JSON envelope for machine consumption.
- **Node.js >= 20.11.0 required.** This is the tested compatibility floor and satisfies the packaged Next.js dashboard's Node 20.9+ requirement. TypeScript compiles to ES2022 with NodeNext module resolution.
- **`ts-morph` is an optional dependency** — scanner functionality degrades gracefully without it.
